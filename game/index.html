    Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub;<br>
    It is the center hole that makes it useful.<br>
    Shape clay into a vessel;<br>
    It is the space within that makes it useful.<br>
    Cut doors and windows for a room;<br>
    It is the holes which make it useful.<br>
    Therefore profit comes from what is there;<br>
    Usefulness from what is not there.
